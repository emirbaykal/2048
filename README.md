##  What did I use?

-  New Input System / WASD - Arrow - Mobile Touch
-  Dependency management with **Zenject**
-  Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
-  Performance optimization using **Object Memory Pooling** with zenject
-  Mobile-friendly screen resolution and UI scaling
-  Unique and modular grid system
- Line-based processing (scroll left/right/up/down and merge algorithm)


-  ### Zenject Highlights:
-  **Dependency Injection** for decoupled and testable code
-  **Signals** for event-based communication between systems
-  MonoInstallers, ScriptableObject Installer
-  **Memory Pooling** using `MonoMemoryPool<T>` for high-performance prefab reuse
-  Singleton lifecycle control
